# Let's Connect

I believe the best conversations happen when we step away from our screens and connect as humans first. Whether you want to discuss a technical challenge, share something you're working on, or just chat about the latest developments in tech, I'd love to hear from you.

## Get in Touch

### üìß **Email**
**[helloosaze@gmail.com](mailto:helloosaze@gmail.com)**

The best way to reach me for longer conversations, technical discussions, or anything that requires a thoughtful response. I typically respond within 24-48 hours.

### üíª **GitHub**
**[@osazeejedi](https://github.com/osazeejedi)**

Check out my code, contribute to my repositories, or start a discussion about development practices. I'm always open to collaboration and code reviews.

### üíº **LinkedIn**
**[Osazee Oghagbon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/osazee-oghagbon/)**

Professional connections, career discussions, and networking. Great for more formal conversations about work and industry trends.
